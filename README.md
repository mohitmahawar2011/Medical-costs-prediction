# Medical-costs-prediction
In This Project find out accurately predict medical insurance costs using Linear Regression &amp; Random Forest model. 
<h1 align="center">Medical Insurance Cost Prediction</h1>

## :innocent: Motivation

To predict things have been never so easy. I used to wonder how Insurance amount is charged normally. So, in the mean time I came across this dataset and thought of working on it! Using this I wanted to know how few features determine our insurance amount!
